                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>The book is about the hobbit Bilbo Baggins, who lives quietly and comfortably in his house in a land called The Shire. He is quite satisfied with his life and doesn´t want any changes, and he certainly doesn´t feel any need to take part in major adventures.</p> 

                <p>In spite of this he sets out on a journey with a party of dwarves to reclaim a lost treasure. He somehow can´t resist it when he´s asked to participate in this quest. In the course of the journey, when the party reaches a mountain range called The Misty Mountains, Bilbo becomes separated from the dwarves, and he gets lost deep down under the mountains.</p>

                <p>In this difficult and dangerous situation he finds a ring, which he puts in his pocket. This ring will later turn out to be very special, and it´s going to play a major part in the story. But right now Bilbo doesn´t pay particular attention to it. Shortly after, he meets a strange creature called Gollum, who has lived under the mountains for many long years.</p>  ​
