                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone is the first book in the British author J.K Rowling’s “series of children’s books, about the boy – Harry Potter – a quite ordinary boy, who turns out to be a great wizard.</p> 

                <p>At the beginning of the book we learn that he is living with his aunt, uncle and cousin, who all tend to treat him rather badly, but all of a sudden he is violently thrown into a world where there are witches, wizards, sorcerers, goblins, ghosts, spiders, giant snakes and much, much more, and we follow right behind him.</p> 

                <p>Harry is the hero everyone dreams of reading about. Brave, yet fearful, with a huge background that amazes us all. We enter into the story just before he learns that he is special. Enjoy.<p>
